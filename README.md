VimConf
=======
This vimconf was made for my personal use and has been compiled from various other public vimrc's, I
am Uploading this here for safekeeping.
Its less configurable than most public vimrc's made for the public because I don't work with
external files to prevent mishaps when updating.
But ofcourse if you happen to stumble on here or you are one of my colleagues you can use and edit this code as much as you want.

* Installs itself
* i've tried to comment every single option
* Autocomplete, syntax checker, plugin manager, file browser and much more

Installation
------------
**Required packages:** clang, ctags, jedi, ruby
    **TODO** testing first

Running vim with this .vimrc will cause it to automaticly install Vundle and a bunch of plugins. (I
hope)
