VimConf
=======
This vimconf was made for my personal use and has been compiled from various other public vimrc's, I
am Uploading this here for safekeeping.
Its less configurable than most public vimrc's made for the public because I don't work with
external files to prevent mishaps when updating.
If you are looking to use someone's vimconf and maybe do a little changes I suggest going for the
more well know ons like timss/vimconf because those are more suited to add your own things, and
probably more updated.
But ofcourse if you happen to stumble on here or you are one of my colleagues you can use and edit this code as much as you want.

* Installs itself
* i've tried to comment every single option
* Autocomplete, syntax checker, plugin manager, file browser and much more

Installation
------------
**Required packages:** clang, ctags, jedi, ruby

    git clone https://github.com/Numkil/VimConf.git
    ln -s VimConf/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

Running vim with this .vimrc will cause it to automaticly install Vundle and a bunch of plugins. (I
hope)

Credits
-------
I should give credits to most of the public .vimrc's out there because well this really is mostly a
compilation of various public .vimrc's with some additions of myself
